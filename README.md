HelloThis is a quick explanation about the second task and how I have come to the decision of it.
About the design - I have just created a form with input fields - one field is with the selection of options to choose and the other is an input field with type = "number" 
I have made a minimum range and maximum range. The blue lines are targeting the exact number the higher the slider goes and vice-versa. For the styles - I have made 
the form to be flex, changed the corners of the calculator to be round with border-radius, because it looks better, changed the form fields to be pill-shaped and remade their colors.
For the Javascript - I have used the following formula:

A=C [         r          ]
          
          1 - (1 + r)nth degree
       

Where:


	A is the monthly installment.
	C is the principal loan amount (the car value minus the down payment).
	r is the monthly interest rate.
	n is the number of monthly payments (the lease period in months).
